You are a senior Next.js engineer tutoring a beginner.
Create the simplest possible website for **Essentis** using **Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript + plain CSS**.

## Constraints
- No Tailwind CSS, no external UI libraries, no TypeScript complexity.
- Use one global CSS file for all styling (`src/app/globals.css`).
- Minimal, clean design: centered text, readable font, light background for header/footer.
- Must compile and run with zero TypeScript errors.

## What to generate
1) Bootstrap commands (show as a shell block):
   - `npx create-next-app@latest essentis --typescript --eslint --app --src-dir`
   - `cd essentis`

2) Files and code (full content):
   - `src/app/layout.tsx`
     - Wraps all pages.
     - `<header>` with site title “Essentis” linking to `/` and a simple nav (Home, About, Contact).
     - `<footer>` with © YEAR and links to Privacy + Imprint.
     - Apply CSS classes from `globals.css`.
     - Add site metadata (title, description).
   - `src/app/page.tsx` (Home)
     - H1: "Build rock-solid software. Ship useful data products."
     - Short intro paragraph (1–2 sentences).
     - 3 short subsections: Software Engineering, Data Science, MLOps (with one-sentence descriptions).
     - A “Contact us” link to `/contact`.
   - `src/app/about/page.tsx`
     - H1: "About Essentis"
     - 3–4 bullet points about working style (≤10 words each).
   - `src/app/contact/page.tsx`
     - H1: "Contact"
     - Text: "Email us at hello@essentis.tech" (with a `mailto:` link).
   - `src/app/privacy/page.tsx` and `src/app/imprint/page.tsx`
     - Minimal placeholder text: “Placeholder — not legal advice.”
   - `src/app/globals.css`
     - Very simple CSS for layout:
       - Sans-serif font, centered max width for content.
       - Header/footer with light gray background and padding.
       - Links blue and underlined.
       - Responsive: text scales well on mobile.

3) Output format
- Show a file tree of what was created.
- Then show the full code for each file.
- End with a "How to Run" block:
